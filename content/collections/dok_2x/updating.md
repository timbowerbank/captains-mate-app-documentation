# Updating

**Updating Dok**
Since Dok is a _starter_ kit, you don't update it in the traditional sense. Once you have purchased and installed Dok, it's all yours. If you want to keep up with bug fixes or new features, you can go through the GIT history.

**Updating plugins**
You can update plugins through Composer. Run `composer update` on the package you want to upgrade.
