# Laravel Precognition

[Laravel Precognition](https://dok-demo.test/dok/3.x/precognition) lets Statamic forms predict the result of a form submission before it actually happens. This makes it possible to add live, real-time validation to your forms using the same validation rules defined on the backend, without duplicating logic in your frontend JavaScript.

Dok comes with Precognition pre-installed incase you ever need it.
