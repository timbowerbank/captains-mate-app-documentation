# Updating

Since Dok is a starter kit, you don't update it in the traditional sense. Once you have purchased and installed Dok, it's all yours. If you want to keep up with bug fixes or new features, you may go through the GIT history.

You can update plugins through Composer. Run `composer update` on the package you want to upgrade.
